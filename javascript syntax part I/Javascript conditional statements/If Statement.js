let sale = false;
//Using the let keyword, declare a variable named sale. Assign the value false to it.

//Notice that the code inside the if statement ran, since 'Time to buy!' was logged to the console.Below the sale variable declaration, 
//but before the if statement, reassign sale to false. Run your code and observe what happens, weâ€™ll be changing this behavior in the next exercise.


if (sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');
}
//Prints: this statement is executed if the condition of sale is true.
