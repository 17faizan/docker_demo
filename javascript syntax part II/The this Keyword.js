In main.js there is an object robot, add a property of model and assign to it a value of '1E78V2'. Add another property, energyLevel and assign to it a value of 100.*/
/*Now to check .provideInfo() has access to the internal properties of robot. Log the result of calling .provideInfo() method on robot to the console.*/
